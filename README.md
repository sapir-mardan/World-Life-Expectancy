A concise SQL-focused project analyzing global life expectancy from 2000–2015. The work demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis using SQL.

## Highlights

* Removed duplicates, handled missing data, and validated dataset integrity
* Built SQL queries to analyze trends across GDP, BMI, and development status
* Compared countries and identified major changes over time
* Showcased ability to work with real-world messy data and extract actionable insights

## What This Shows

* Strong SQL query writing
* Proficiency in data cleaning and preparation
* Analytical thinking and ability to derive insights from datasets

## Files

*(Add this below the Files section)*
The SQL used in this project is presented as screenshots within the notebook, and a full `.sql` file is now included for direct review. This still demonstrates query structure, logic, and workflow even though the raw `.sql` files are not included.

* **World Life Expectancy Project.ipynb** – full SQL workflow and commentary
* **queries.sql** – SQL script containing all queries used in the project

## How to View
